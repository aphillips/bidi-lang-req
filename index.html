<section id="Introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Natural language information on the Web depends on and benefits from 
the presence of language and direction metadata. Along with support for 
Unicode, mechanisms for including and specifying the base direction and 
language of spans of text are one of the key considerations in 
development of new formats and technologies for the Web.</p>

<p>Markup formats, such as HTML and XML, as well as related styling 
languages, such as CSS and XSL, are reasonably mature and provide support for 
the interchange and presentation of the world's langauges via built-in 
features.</p>

<p>This document was developed as a result of observations by the 
Internationalization Working Group over a series of specification 
reviews related to formats based on JSON, WebIDL, and other 
non-markup data languages. Unlike markup formats, such as XML, these 
data languages generally do not provide extensible attributes and were 
not conceived with built-in language or direction metadata.</p>
	
	
<section id="Why is this important?">
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>

<p>The language of content is important when processing and presenting 
natural language data for a variety of reasons. When this data is not 
present, the resulting degradation in appearance or functionality can 
frustrate users&mdash;or render the content unintelligible. Some of the 
affected processes include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Selection of fonts and rendering to prevent "ransom noting" 
	(and especially the selection of the correct 
	Chinese/Japanese/Korean font due to important presentational 
	variations for the same characters in these languages)</li> 
	<li>Spell checking and other content checking (such as abuse 
	detection) </li> 
	<li>Indexing, search, and other natural language 
	text operations </li> 
	<li>Filtering according to intended audience 
	and language negotiation </li>
	<li>Selection of a text-to-speech voice and processor, such as used 
	for accessibility or in a voice-based interface</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, direction metadata is important to the Web. When a string 
contains text in a script that runs right-to-left (RTL), it must be 
possible to eventually display that string correctly when it reaches an 
end user. For that to happen, it is necessary to establish what 'base 
direction' needs to be applied to the string as a whole. The 
appropriate base direction cannot always be deduced by simply looking 
at the string; even if it were possible, the producer and consumer of 
the string would need to use the same heuristics to interpret its 
direction.</p>
  
<p>Static content, such as the body of a Web page or the contents of an 
e-book, often has language or direction information provided by the document format 
or as part of the content metadata. Data formats found on the Web 
generally do not supply this metadata. Base specifications such as 
Microformats, WebIDL, JSON, and more, have tended to store natural 
language text in string objects, without additional metadata.</p>

<p>This places a burden on application authors and data format 
designers to provide the metadata on their own initiative. When 
standardized formats do not address the resulting issues, the result 
can be that, while the data arrives intact, its processing or 
presentation cannot be wholly recovered.</p>
</section>

<section id="Isn't Unicode Enough?">
<h3>Isn't Unicode Enough?</h3>

<p>[[!Unicode]] and its character encodings (such as UTF-8) are key elements 
of the Web and its formats. They provide the ability to encode and 
exchange text in any language consistently throughout the Internet. 
However, Unicode by itself does not guarantee perfect presentation and 
processing of natural language text, even though it does guarantee 
perfect interchange.</p>

<p>Several features of Unicode are sometimes suggested as part of the 
solution to providing language and direction metadata. Specificially, 
Unicode bidi controls are suggested for handling direction metadata. In 
addition, there are "tag" characters in the U+E0000 block of Unicode 
for use as language tags. These characters are deprecated and their use 
is "strongly discouraged" (to quote Unicode).</p>

<p>There are a variety of reasons why the addition of characters to 
data in an interchange format is not a good idea. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most data sources (used to assemble data files) do not contain 
  these characters; the processing assembling or serializing the data 
  will need to introspect and insert the necessary characters.</li>
  <li>Many data formats have externally provided limitations on 
  content, such the length limits. Inserting additional characters into 
  the data may violate these externally applied requirements, interfere 
  with processing. In the worst case, the data values may be corrupted 
  or lost as a result.</li>
</ul>

<section id="Language Identification">
	<h2>Language Identification</h2>
<section id="Definitions">
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p><dfn id="langmeta">Language metadata</dfn> typically indicates the 
intended linguistic audience or user of the resource as a whole, and 
it's possible to imagine that this could, for a multilingual resource, 
involve a property value that is a list of languages. A property that 
is about language metadata may have more than one value, since it aims 
to describe all potential users of the information</p>

<p><dfn id="tpl">Text-processing language</dfn> is the language of a 
particular range of text (which could be a whole resource or just part 
of it). A property that represents the text-processing language needs 
to have a single value, because it describes the text content in such a 
way that tools such as spell-checkers, default font applicators, 
hyphenation and line breakers, case converters, voice browsers, and 
other language-sensitive applications know which set of rules or 
resources to apply to a specific range of text. Such applications 
generally need an unambiguous statement about the language they are 
working on.</p>

</section>

<section id="Language Tagging Use Cases">
<h2>Language Tagging Use Cases</h2>
<p>Kensuke is reading an old Tibetan manuscript from the Dunhuang 
collection. The tool he is using to read the manuscript has access to 
annotations created by scholars working in the various languages of the 
International Dunhuang Project, who are commenting on the text. The  
section of the manuscript he is currently looking at has commentaries 
by people writing in Chinese, Japanese and Russian. Each of these 
commentaries is stored in a separate  annotation, but the annotations 
point to the same point in the target document. Each commentary is 
mainly written in the language of the scholar, but may contain excerpts 
from the manuscript and other sources written in Tibetan as well quoted 
text in Chinese and English.</p> 

<p>Kensuke speaks Japanese, so he wants to be presented with the 
Japanese commentary.</p>

<p>The body containing the Japanese commentary has a <code class="kw" 
translate="no">language</code> property set to <code class="kw" 
translate="no">ja</code> (Japanese). The tool he is using knows that he 
wants to read Japanese commentaries, and it uses this information to 
select and present to him the text contained in that body.  This is 
language information being used as metadata – it indicates to the 
application doing the retrieval that the intended consumer of the 
information  wants Japanese. </p>

<p>The Japanese commentary for this particular annotation starts with a 
sentence in Japanese, but later contains some excerpts from Chinese and 
Tibetan sources. It's possible for the value of the <code class="kw" 
translate="no">language</code> property, when used as metadata, to 
contain three language tags, <code class="kw" 
translate="no">ja,zh,bo</code> (japanese, chinese, and tibetan, 
respectively), but i'm not sure how useful that is in this particular 
use case. </p>

<p>Having identified the relevant annotation text to present to 
Kensuke, his application has to then display it so that he can read it. 
It's important to apply the correct font to the text. In the following 
examples, the first paragraph has no language tag applied. The 
subsequent paragraphs are labeled <code class="kw">ja</code> 
(<em>Japanese</em>), <code class="kw">zh-Hans</code> (<em>Simplified 
Chinese</em>), and <code class="kw">zh-Hant</code> (<em>Traditional 
Chinese</em>) respectively.</p>

<p class="cjk-demo"> 雪, 刃, 直, 令, 垔 </p>
<p class="cjk-demo" lang="ja"> 雪, 刃, 直, 令, 垔 </p>
<p class="cjk-demo" lang="zh-Hans"> 雪, 刃, 直, 令, 垔 </p>
<p class="cjk-demo" lang="zh-Hant"> 雪, 刃, 直, 令, 垔 </p>

<p>You should be able to see slight but important differences in 
Japanese vs Chinese fonts. It's important to apply a Japanese font to 
the Japanese text that Kensuke is reading. There are also 
language-specific differences in the way text is wrapped at the end of 
a line. For these reasons we need to identify the actual language of 
the text to which the font or the wrapping algorithm will be applied. 
Also, a voice browser will need to know whether to use Japanese or 
Chinese pronunciations for the ideographic characters contained in the 
annotation body text, and as mentioned before, various other text 
rendering or analysis tools need to know the language of the text they 
are dealing with.</p> 

<p>If the <code class="kw" translate="no">language</code> property 
value contains only <code class="kw" translate="no">ja</code>, that's a 
good indicator that the application should expect the first sentence 
and the annotation in general to be in Japanese, unless instructed 
otherwise.  If, however, the <code class="kw" 
translate="no">language</code> property has the value <code class="kw" 
translate="no">bo,ja,zh</code>, it's not clear what the default font, 
etc, should be. In that case, we need a way to indicate that the first 
sentence in the text presented to Kensuke is actually in Japanese.</p> 

<p>We also need a way to indicate the change of language to Chinese and 
Tibetan later in the commentary for this annotation, so that 
appropriate fonts and wrapping algorithms can be applied there. One 
proposal from members of the Annotation WG was to require HTML/XML 
formats for such annotation bodies, and use the <code class="kw" 
translate="no">lang</code> or <code class="kw" 
translate="no">xml:lang</code> attributes in markup to denote the 
language changes.</p> 

<p>(Use case from Felix) If Kensuke's body contains quoted text in 
Chinese and Tibetan it would be useful to know that if you were someone 
who wanted to locate all annotations containing text in more than one 
language.</p>

page in Firefox and Chrome to see the differences. The default font for 
one is Japanese, the other Chinese. See also <a

<section id="litmus">
  <h2>Litmus tests</h2> <p>If your specification or application 
  provides a way of correctly displaying the following strings when 
  they reach the point of display to the user, you will have solved the 
  majority of the problems. For that to happen, there must be a way to 
  tell  the required base direction for each string.</p>
  
  <p>All examples show characters from left to right in the order they 
  are stored in memory. We use Hebrew text so as to avoid issues 
  related to the display of cursive characters in Arabic. We will also 
  use these tests as examples for the concepts on this page.</p>
  
  <p>Tests 1-4 need to be displayed using an RTL base direction. Test 5 
  needs to be displayed as LTR text.</p>
  
<section id="test1">
  <h3>Test #1</h3>
  <p dir="rtl" style="text-align:center;"><code><bdo dir="ltr">&quot;בינלאומי!&quot;</bdo></code>  </p>
  <p>For presentation to a user, the  characters above should be presented in the reverse order to what you see on this page. The Hebrew characters will be reversed by applying the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UBA). However, the UBA cannot make the exclamation mark appear to the left of the Hebrew text, where it belongs, unless the base direction is set to RTL.</p>
  <p>This is what the text of the string should look like if displayed correctly by a consumer:&nbsp; <img src="string-base-direction-data/test1.png" alt="Test 1"/></p>

<section id="test2">
  <h3>Test #2</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code>
    <bdo dir="ltr">&quot;bidi בינלאומי&quot;</bdo>
  </code></p>
  <p>For presentation to a user, the text &quot;bidi&quot; must appear to the right of the Hebrew letters.<code></code> The UBA cannot do this unless it knows that the overall base direction is RTL.</p>
  <p>This is what the text of the string should look like if displayed correctly by a consumer:&nbsp; <img src="string-base-direction-data/test2.png" alt="Test 2"/></p>

  <h3>Test #3</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code><bdo dir="ltr">&quot;&lt;span&gt;בינלאומי!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;</bdo></code></p>
  <p>This test is intended for consuming applications that treat the markup in the string as actual markup. As for test #1, the exclamation mark must appear to the left of the Hebrew letters, regardless of the LTR directionality of the markup surrounding it.</p>
  <p>This is what the text of the string should look like if displayed correctly by a consumer:&nbsp; <img src="string-base-direction-data/test1.png" alt="Test 3"/></p>

    <bdo dir="ltr">&quot;&lt;span dir='rtl'&gt;one שתיים three&lt;/span&gt;&quot;</bdo></code></p>
  <p>If the consuming application is expected to parse the markup as actual markup, the list in the element content above should be displayed to the user in the order &quot;three שתיים one&quot;.<code></code> This requires the UBA to know that the intended base direction of the string is RTL. The key point of this test is that the base direction information is carried in the markup.</p>

<section id="mainpoint">
  <h2>The main issue</h2>
  <p>The main issue is how  a consumer of a string will know what  base direction should be used for that string when it is eventually displayed to a user. A number of alternatives are considered below.</p>

</section>




<section id="ancilliary">
  <h2>Ancillary issues</h2>
  <p>Apart from the question of how a consumer will know what base direction to use for a string, the following are things that need to be considered for an end to end process that supports proper application of base direction to strings.</p>

<section id="producers">
  <h3>Producing</h3>
  <p>A string may become a string in a number of ways, including a content author typing strings into a plain text editor or text message, or a script scraping text from web pages, or acquisition of an existing set of strings from another application or repository, or, if you are lucky, a dedicated system with an interface that allows base direction to be specified during input. In this article, the <b class="newterm">producer</b> of a string is the human or mechanism that creates a string for storage or transmission to a consumer of strings.</p>
  <p>When a  string is created, it's necessary to (a) detect the appropriate base direction to be associated with the string, and (b) take steps, where needed, to set the string up in a way that communicates the base direction.</p>
  <p><code></code>For example, in the case of a string that is extracted from an HTML form, the base direction can be detected from the computed value of the form's field. Such a value could be inherited from an earlier element, such as the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> element, or set using markup or styling on the <code class="kw" translate="no">input</code> element itself. The user could also set the direction of the text by <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-dir#userexplicit">using  keyboard shortcut keys</a> to change the direction of the form field. The <code class="kw" translate="no">dirname</code> attribute provides a way of automatically communicating that value with a form submission.</p>
  <p>If the producer of the string is receiving the string from a location where it was stored by another producer, and where the base direction has already been established, the producer should understand that the base direction has already been set.</p>
</section>

<section id="consumers">
  <h3>Consuming</h3>
  <p>A <b class="newterm">consumer</b> is an application or process that takes a string and places it into a context where it will be exposed to a user. It must ensure that the base direction of the string is correctly applied to the string in that context. </p>
  <p>Applying the base direction may involve constructing additional markup or adding control codes or some such to indicate the base direction. It must also isolate embedded strings from the surrounding text to avoid spill-over effects of the bidi algorithm.</p>
</section>

<section id="agreements">
  <h3>Decoding information  </h3>
  <p>Any time a producer of a string takes special steps to add information about the base direction of that string it must do so with the expectation that the consumer of the string will understand how the producer did so. Even if no action is taken by the producer, the consumer must decide what rules to follow in order to decide on the appropriate base direction.</p>
  <p>In some systems, the behaviour of the producer and the consumer of a string will both be specified. In others, such agreements may not be available.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="firststrong">
  <h2>First-strong</h2>
  <p> First-strong detection looks for the first character with a strong Unicode directional property in a string, and sets the base direction to match it. Many developers assume that this provides a robust solution, but first-strong detection alone is not always adequate to communicate base direction.</p>
  <p>Note that, if the producer is relying  on the consumer using first-strong character detection to establish the contextual base direction of a string, the consumer  needs to be aware that it should also use that approach. Although first-strong detection is outlined in the UBA, it is not the only possible higher level protocol mentioned for detecting string direction. For example, Twitter and Facebook currently use different default heuristics for guessing the base direction of text – neither use just simple first-strong detection, and one uses a completely different method.</p>
  <p>The first-strong detection algorithm needs to skip characters at the start of the string that don't have a strong directional property.</p>
  <p>It also needs to skip embedded runs of text that are directionally isolated from the text around it, if it is to follow the UBA. Isolation may be achieved by Unicode formatting characters, such as RLI, LRI and FSI, or by markup in the string if that markup is to be interpreted as actual markup by the consumer (eg. &lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt; in HTML5).</p>
  <p>The principle problem encountered with first-strong detection is that the first strong character is not always representative of the base direction that needs to be applied to that string, such as in test #2 above.</p>
  <p>If a string contains markup that will be parsed by the consumer as markup, there are additional problems. Any such markup at the start of the string must also be skipped when searching for the first strong directional character. If, however, there is angle bracket content that is intended to be an <em>example</em> of markup, rather than actual markup, the markup must not be skipped. It isn't clear how a consumer of the string would know the difference between this case and the previous one.</p>
  <p>If parseable markup in the string contains information about the intended direction of the string, that information should be used rather than relying on first-strong heuristics. This is problematic in a couple of ways: (a) it assumes that the consumer of the string understands the semantics of the markup, which may be ok if there is an agreement between all parties to use, say, HTML markup only, but would be problematic when dealing with random XML vocabularies, and (b) the consumer must be able to to recognise and handle a situation where only the initial part of the string has markup, ie. the markup applies to an inline span of text rather than the string as a whole.</p>
  <p>If no strong directional character is found in the string, the direction should be assumed to be LTR.  </p>
  <p>The remaining sections look at ways that a string may be stored with additional information where text direction cannot be detected accurately by the first-strong method.</p>
</section>




<section id="rlm">
  <h2>Augmenting first-strong by inserting RLM markers</h2>
  <p>It is possible for a producer of a string to attach an RLM/LRM character to the beginning of  those strings where the wrong base direction would otherwise be assumed when using a simple first-strong heuristic. </p>
  <p>If the producer is a human, they could theoretically apply one of these characters when creating a string in order to signal the directionality, although they are very likely to not have a way of inputting RLM/LRM characters, especially on mobile devices.</p>
  <p>However, humans often create text that will later become strings in environments where such action is unnecessary.  For example, if a person types information into an HTML form and relies on the form's base direction or use of shortcut keys to make the string look correct in the form field, they would not need to add RLM/LRM  to make the string 'look correct' for themselves, but outside of that context the string would look incorrect unless an appropriate strong character was added to it. Similarly, strings scraped from a web page that has <code class="kw" translate="no">dir=rtl</code> set in the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> element would not normally have or need an RLM/LRM character at the start of the string in HTML.</p>
  <p>This approach is therefore only appropriate for general use if it is acceptable to change the value of the string. </p>
  <p>Apart from changing the identity of the string, adding characters to it may have an effect on things such as string length or pointer positions, which may become problematic.</p>
  <p>As a variant of the first-strong heuristic approach, the consumer would still need to also use first-strong heuristics to apply the correct directionality to the string.</p>
  <p>If directional information is contained in markup that will be parsed as such by the consumer (eg. <code class="kw" translate="no">dir=rtl</code> in HTML),  the producer  of the string should understand that markup in order to set or not set an RLM/LRM character as appropriate. If the producer always adds RLM/LRM to the start of such strings, the consumer should know that. If it relies instead on the markup being understood, the consumer needs to understand the markup.</p>
  <p>The producer of a string should not automatically apply RLM or LRM to the start of the string, but  should test whether it is needed. For example, if there's already an RLM there, no need to add another. If the context is correctly conveyed by first-strong heuristics, no need to add additional characters either. Note, however, that testing whether supplementary directional information of this kind is needed is only possible if the producer has access, and knows that it has access, to the original context of the string.</p>

  <p>This approach inserts paired Unicode formatting characters at the start and end of a string to indicate the base direction. </p>
  <p>If paired formatting characters are used, they should be isolating, ie. starting with RLI, LRI, FSI, and not with RLE or LRE.</p>
  <p>However, It would not be enough to simply apply the UBA first-strong heuristics to such a string, because the Unicode bidi algorithm is unable to ascertain the base direction for a string that starts with RLI/LRI/FSI and ends with PDI. This is because the algorithm skips over isolated sequences and treats them  as a neutral character.  A consumer of the string would have to take special steps, in this case, to uncover the first-strong character. </p>
  <p>This approach is also only appropriate if it is acceptable to change the value of the string. In addition to possible issues  such as changed string length or pointer positions, this approach runs the risk of  one of the paired characters getting lost, either through handling errors, or through text truncation, etc.</p>
  <p>A  producer and a consumer of a string would need to recognise and handle a situation where a string begins with a paired formatting character but doesn't end with it  because the formatting characters only describe a part of the string. </p>
  <p>Unicode specifies a limit to the number of embeddings that are effective, and embeddings could build up over time to exceed that limit.</p>
  <p>Consuming applications would need to recognise and appropriately handle the isolating formatting characters. At the moment such support for RLI/LRI/FSI is not pervasive.</p>

  <h2>Metadata</h2>
  <p>If it is possible to pass metadata with the string and the consumer knows how to retrieve the meaning of that metadata, this can provide a simple, effective and efficient method of communicating the intended base direction without affecting the actual content of the string.</p>
  <p>Metadata not only removes the problem of whether or not, and how, to parse markup in a string to determine the direction, but even in the simplest strings, without markup, it avoids the need to inspect and run heuristics on the string to determine its base direction.</p>
  <p>There needs to be metadata available for each individual string. Alternatively, metadata can be inherited, but some mechanism must be available to override the inherited direction for a particular string which differs in direction from the inherited value.  </p>
  <p>Metadata is probably most effective, however (especially for the original creator of the strings), if it is only passed with a string in those cases where first-strong detection is otherwise going to produce a wrong result. This would mean that consumers of strings should not only recognise the metadata, but should also expect to  rely on first-strong heuristics for strings without metadata. It also means that producers of strings need to recognise situations where directional information is needed and set the metadata.</p>
